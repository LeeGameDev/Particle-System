 Little Miss Aligned Little Miss Aligned is a puzzle game developed in Unity that takes place in a 3D environment and uses camera perspective within this 3D world to solve puzzles using 2D logic.  The game world revolves around a travelling carnival that has come to visit a small town in early autumn. The colours and objects will be cartoon, childlike, and playful. Things do not always make sense in the world, but the main character uses her imagination to overcome obstacles in her way.  Squares Attack! Long ago, the Squares had decided they were the master shape. They waged war on the other shapes. One by one each shape was systematically wiped out. This tragic genocide became known as the "Great Vertex Cleansing".   That was so long ago...   Now there remains only one shape, and all it can do, is hope to survive.  Projects  Particle System Tool This is a project I worked on with a partner. We took a simple C++ particle engine and made a C# tool that could create emitters and draw particles. After a great amount of data marshalling we ended up with a pretty solid result.
